# Reinforcement learning and optimal control for robotics (ROB-GY 6323)

This repository provides material used for the class **Reinforcement learning and optimal control for robotics** (ROB-GY 6323) taught at New York University by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti).
You are free to use and copy this material (at your own risk), please reference the material if you use it.

## Working with python
We work with Python 3.8 using numpy, scipy, matplotlib and Jupyter notebooks.

Conda is a straightforward, multi-platform, easy-to-use python distribution. It can be downloaded [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and instructions to get started are available [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)

Jupyter is a great way to create notebooks for python. A simple tutorial with Jupyter Lab can be found [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)
